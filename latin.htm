    <p><strong>Latin</strong> is a classical <a href='language'>language</a>, primarily used by the now-extinct <a href='roman.htm'>Roman Empire</a>. As a classical language, its history stretches very far back with an estimated ~2700 years since its inception. Once the <a href='lingua-franca.htm'><i>lingua franca</i> (common languange)</a> of the Roman Empire, it was reduced to the common language for educated peoples. Today, Latin is considered a dead language, with no primary speakers and no native country or peoples. However, Latin was and continues to be used as the foremost language in many aspects of <a href='science.htm'>science</a> and <a href='religion.htm'>religion.</p>
    <p>Latin originates from the lower Tiber area in <a href='italy.htm'>Italy</a>, called <u>Latium</u>, around <a href='rome.htm'>Rome</a>. This area was the roots of the Roman Empire. Latin then spread along as the Empire expanded, leaving Latin as the sole language for education. After the Roman Empire <a href='west-re.htm'>sp</a><a href='byzantium.htm'>lit</a> and collapsed, many intellectuals continued to use Latin for the next ~1500 years.</p>
    <p>Latin is divided into 2 types: <u>Vulgar Latin</u>, and <u>Ecclesiastical Latin</u>. Vulgar Latin was used as the main spoken language, while ecclasiastical Latin was used for official government functions, religious texts, and mainly by highly-educated <a href='aristocracy.htm'>aristocrats</a>. Vulgar Latin would then develop into what is now called the <a href='romance-lang.htm'>Romance languages</a>, which include <a href='france.htm'>France</a> and <a href='romania.htm'>Romania</a>. Ecclesiastical Latin is still used today by the many <a href='christianity.htm>Christian denominations</a> ('variants').</p>

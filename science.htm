    <p><strong>Science</strong> is a systemic and rigourous endavour which builds, organises and maintains knowledge. Science relies on testable explanations, logical reasoning and, predictions about the world and beyond.
    Science orginally meant 'knowledge' or 'learning', and thus 'science' covers a very wide range of subjects, typically organised into three main types.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural sciences, e.g. &mdash; physics, biology, chemistry</li>
        <li>Social sciences, e.g. &mdash; sociology, economics, political science</li>
        <li>Formal sciences, e.g. &mdash; mathematics, logics, computer science</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Defining features of Science includes heavy reliance on <u>empirical evidence</u> (in the forms of tests and statistics), as well as hypotheses and predictions of events via logical reasoning and present empirical evidence.</p>
    <p>Science is used in many aspects of life and living. Science such as <b>applied sciences</b> are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medicine.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>Science derives from the <a href='latin.htm'>Latin</a> word, <i>scientia</i>, for knowing, meaning 'knowing, awareness, understanding', and the past participle form of <i>scientia</i>, <i>sciens</i>, meaning 'to know' or 'to understand'.</p>
